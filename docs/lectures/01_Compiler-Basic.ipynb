    "## Compiler Formalization\n",
    "\n",
    "In compiler design, it's essential to precisely describe the input (source code) and output (machine code) of a compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** Source code (programming language)  \n",
    "**Output:** Assembly (machine) code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Describing Programming Language Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages have two crucial components: syntax and semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax defines which strings of symbols are valid expressions in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example (C++):\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "int z = 0;  // Valid statement\n",
    "std::cout << \"z+1=\" << z++ << std::endl;  // Valid statement\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantics defines the meaning or behavior of valid expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Describing Syntax using BNF Grammar\n",
    "\n",
    "Backus-Naur Form (BNF) is a formal notation used to describe the syntax of programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example BNF Grammar:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bnf\n",
    "<Statement> ::= <AssignmentSt> | <ForST> | '{' <StatementList> '}' | ùúñ\n",
    "<AssignmentSt> ::= <Id> '=' <Exper>\n",
    "<ForST> ::= 'for' <Id> '=' <Expr> 'to' <Expr> <DoPart>\n",

    "## Compilation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiling a program involves several steps, and it's crucial to understand the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intermediate Representations (IRs):**\n",
    "   - Compiler uses different program Intermediate Representations.\n",
    "   - These IRs facilitate necessary program manipulations (analysis, optimization, code generation).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Compilation Steps in C++:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "#include <iostream>\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "    int z = 0;\n",

    "## Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The JIT compiler, or dynamic translator, reads bytecodes (in a bytecode-compiled system) in many sections (or in full, rarely) and compiles them dynamically into machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This can be done per-file, per-function, or even on any arbitrary code fragment.\n",
    "- As a result, the program can run faster.\n",
    "- Provides lazy/late compiling.\n",
    "- The code can be compiled when it is about to be executed and then cached and reused later without needing to be recompiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of JIT Compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved Performance:**\n",
    "   - JIT compilation can result in faster execution of the program since machine code is generated dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lazy Compilation:**\n",
    "   - Compilation is deferred until the code is about to be executed. This allows for better optimization decisions based on runtime information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Caching and Reuse:**\n",
    "   - Once code is compiled, it can be cached and reused in subsequent executions, reducing the need for repeated compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adaptability:**\n",
    "   - JIT compilation allows for adaptability to the runtime environment, optimizing the code based on the specific characteristics of the executing system.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation is a technique employed in the field of compiler design to enhance the runtime performance of programs. Unlike traditional ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, where source code is translated into machine code before execution, JIT compilation occurs dynamically during program execution. This approach combines elements of interpretation and compilation, seeking to leverage the advantages of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "In JIT compilation, the source code is initially translated into an intermediate representation, often referred to as bytecode or an intermediate language. This intermediate code is not directly executed by the hardware but is designed to be more portable and platform-independent than the original source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "During runtime, as the program is executed, the JIT compiler analyzes the intermediate code and translates it into machine code that is specific to the underlying hardware architecture. This process occurs on-the-fly, just before the corresponding code is executed, hence the term \"just-in-time.\" The generated machine code is then executed directly by the hardware, resulting in potentially improved performance compared to interpreting the original source or intermediate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bytecode-Compiled Systems:**\n",
    "  - Commonly used in virtual machines that execute bytecode, such as Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or Common Language Runtime (CLR) in .NET.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Execution Speed Optimization:**\n",
    "  - JIT compilation is employed to improve the execution speed of programs, especially in environments where interpretation of high-level code would be too slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency:**\n",
    "  - By compiling only the necessary portions of code during runtime, JIT compilation can contribute to more efficient memory usage.\n",
