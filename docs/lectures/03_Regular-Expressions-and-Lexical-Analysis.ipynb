    "### Lexical Analysis Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** The primary objective of lexical analysis is to partition an input string into meaningful elements called tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks of Lexical Analyzer:**\n",
    "1. Recognize substrings corresponding to tokens.\n",
    "2. Return tokens with their categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Tasks:**\n",
    "- Read input characters of the source program.\n",
    "- Group them into lexemes.\n",
    "- Produce, as output, a sequence of tokens for each lexeme in the source program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "- The output of lexical analysis is a stream of tokens, which serves as the input to the parser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "- A language over $ Σ $ is a subset of $ Σ* $ (set of all words over $ Σ $ ).\n",
    "- Alphabet $ Σ: A $ finite set of elements.\n",
    "- For the lexer: Characters.\n",
    "- For the parser: Token classes/symbol types.\n",
    "- Words (strings): Sequences of elements from the alphabet Σ.\n",
    "- Example: If $ Σ = \\{𝑎, 𝑏\\} $, then $ Σ* = \\{\\epsilon, 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑎𝑎, 𝑎𝑏, 𝑏𝑎, 𝑏𝑏, 𝑎𝑎𝑎, 𝑎𝑎𝑏, 𝑎𝑏𝑎, ...\\} $\n",
    "- Example of an infinite language over $Σ: 𝐿1 = \\{𝑎𝑏, 𝑎𝑏𝑎𝑏, 𝑎𝑏𝑎𝑏𝑎𝑏, ...\\} = \\{{(𝑎𝑏)}^𝑛 | 𝑛 ≥ 1\\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal Languages Description Notations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sets:** $ 𝐿1 = \\{ {}𝑎^{𝑛} 𝑏 | 𝑛 ≥ 0 \\} $\n",
    "2. **Grammars:** `<𝐴> ::= 𝑎𝐴 | 𝑏`\n",

    "4. **Regular Expressions (Regex):** Used only for regular languages.\n",
    "   - Example: 𝑎*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal Grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "- 𝐺 = {𝑁, Σ, 𝑃, 𝑆}, where\n",
    "  - 𝑁: A finite set 𝑁 of nonterminal symbols, disjoint from the strings formed from 𝐺.\n",
    "  - Σ: A finite set of terminal symbols, disjoint from 𝑁.\n",
    "  - 𝑃: A finite set 𝑃 of production rules, each rule of the form 𝛼 → 𝛽.\n",
    "  - 𝑆: A distinguished symbol 𝑆 ∈ 𝑁, the start symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convention:**\n",
    "- Use small letters for terminals and capital letters for non-terminals or variables when writing grammar production rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular Grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "- A grammar 𝐺 = (𝑁, Σ, 𝑃, 𝑆) is right-linear if all productions are of the form:\n",
    "  - 𝐴 → 𝑥𝐵 | 𝑥 | 𝜖, where 𝐴, 𝐵 ∈ 𝑁 and 𝑥 ∈ Σ*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "- A grammar is left-linear if all productions are of the form:\n",
    "  - 𝐴 → 𝐵𝑥 | 𝑥 | 𝜖, where 𝐴, 𝐵 ∈ 𝑁 and 𝑥 ∈ Σ*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regular Grammar:**\n",
    "- A regular grammar is one that is either right-linear or left-linear."
